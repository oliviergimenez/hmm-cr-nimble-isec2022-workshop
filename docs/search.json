      "contents": "\nThe hidden Markov modelling (HMM) framework has gained much attention\nin the ecological literature over the last decade, and has been\nsuggested as a general modelling framework for the demography of plant\nand animal populations. In particular, HMMs are increasingly used to\nanalyse capture-recapture data and estimate key population parameters\n(e.g., survival, dispersal, recruitment or abundance) with applications\nin all fields of ecology.\nIn parallel, Bayesian statistics is relatively well established in\necology and related disciplines, because it resonates with scientific\nreasoning and allows accommodating uncertainty smoothly. The popularity\nof Bayesian statistics also comes from the availability of free pieces\nof software that allow practitioners to code their own analyses.\nIn this half-a-day workshop, we offer a Bayesian treatment of HMMs\napplied to capture-recapture data. Through a combination of lectures,\nreal case studies and live demonstrations, you will get acquainted with\nmulti-site, multi-state and multi-event capture-recapture models.\nWe will use the R Nimble package that is seen by many as\nthe future of ecological data modelling because it i) helps overcome\ncomputational limitations that ecologists are faced with when dealing\nwith complex models and/or big data, and iii) provides samplers that can\ndeal with discrete latent states that are typical of capture-recapture\ndata analysis.\nYou may check a longer version of this workshop here.\nA book is also on its way, you may check the online version there.\nWho: Olivier Gimenez, Daniel Turek\nWhen: Sunday, 26 June 2022\nWhere: Online\nProgram\nAll times are Cape Town/Paris time UTC+2\nWhat you see is not what you get: Hidden Markov models and\ncapture-recapture data (9:00am-9:45am)\nOn the move: Transition estimation (10:00am-10:45am)\nKnown knowns, unknown knowns and unknowns: Uncertainty in state\nassignment (11:00am-11:45am)\nSkip your coffee break: Speed up MCMC convergence\n(noon-12:45pm)\nRequirements\nInstall R\nand RStudio.\nInstall Nimble following these guidelines. Then run the\nfollowing code in R. If that runs without error, you’re all\nset. If not, please get in touch with us.\n\n\nlibrary(nimble)\n  code <- nimbleCode({\n  y ~ dnorm(0,1)\n  })\n  model <- nimbleModel(code)\n  cModel <- compileNimble(model)\n  \n\n\nInstall the following R packages:\ntidyverse, MCMCvis, here and\nnimbleEcology. You can install them all at once by running\nthe following code in R:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"MCMCvis\", \"here\", \"nimbleEcology\"))\n  \n\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
